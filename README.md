Blood Donation Portal

The Blood Donation Portal is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap
between blood donors and recipients, streamlining the process of blood donation and
ensuring timely availability of blood in emergency situations. This system allows
donors to register and update their availability status, while recipients or hospitals
can search for suitable donors based on blood group and location. It integrates
features such as real-time notifications, blood bank listings, donor eligibility checks,
and appointment scheduling. The portal enhances communication, reduces manual
efforts, and promotes voluntary blood donation through awareness modules. By
leveraging modern technologies, this portal aims to create a reliable, accessible, and
efficient blood donation ecosystem that can save lives and promote community
health
